How to install a prepared PrintLayout plugin jar file
=====================================================

This is a description how to install a prepared jar-file.
Along with this text you should find a file printlayout.jar.

If you work with CVS versions, your should now better refer
to the file README.txt.

1. Copy the the printlayout.jar
   into the the lib/ext directory of
   your OpenJump installation.

ATTENTION: The next steps replace existing jar files. Be sure
you don't get into trouble when you loose these files. Backups
or a separate installation of OpenJump could help here.

2. Remove the batik libraries coming with
   OpenJump and replace them:

   rm -rf <where you installed OpenJump>/lib/batik

3. Download these jar files and place them into
   <where you installed OpenJump>/lib
