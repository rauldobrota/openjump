<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Extra Wait:</b><br>
  Database and WMS layers are rendered asynchronous. 
  Due to a limitation in the *JUMP rendering engine it is
  not easy to synchronize map imports when these kinds
  of layers are used.<br>
  Set this field to a postive number of seconds that
  you want to wait after the 'officially' rendering
  has ended. This may help to catch up with the asynchronous
  rendered layers.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Extra Zoom Wait:</b><br>
  When using preview maps the plugin uses only simple
  screen shots of the current map view which are placed
  in the layout. If you are going to export the layout
  (e.g. print it, store it to JPG or SVG) the map view
  is zoomed back to the original positions and the real
  map exports are done. This zooming around takes some
  time. Set 'Extra Zoom Wait' parameter to a number
  of seconds that will be waited before the map export
  is done. That helps to get in sync with the GIS panel.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Optimize Map:</b><br>
  The SVG representation of the map coming from *JUMP
  is not very smart formed in terms of SVG and uses
  a lot of memory. If this option is enabled some
  reorganisations are performed to improve this situation.
  This is highly recommended even if it takes some time!
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Use CSS for map styling:</b><br>
  If you import maps from *JUMP the graphical attributes
  are normally stored right beside the geometries. If you
  have a lot of equal styled features (e.g. with fill patterns)
  it saves some resources if you enable this option. In this
  case a class for each unique set of attributes is build and
  the geometries only store references to this class.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Left/Bottom/Right/Top Border</b><br>
  Normally a printer prints its documents with a specific border.
  To have a visible feedback in the layout plugin you can configure 
  some help lines.

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Use map simpilfication:</b><br>
  Importing the raw geometries from GIS may result in a level of detail which
  is potentially higher than needed in the print out. If you enable this
  option you can simplify the geometries a bit before the import is done.
  If you have e.g. a polygon with 5,000 vertices projected to a paper 
  square of 1cm x 1cm it is very unlikely that you can see all the different 
  vertices. Depending on the given simplification tolerance this also reduces the 
  quantity of used memory. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Simplification tolerance:</b><br>
  If you have turned on the map simplification this value is used as
  the simplification tolerance in terms of paper size [mm]. If you 
  e.g. decide that errors smaller than a quarter of a milli metre on 
  the paper are acceptable for you layout set this to 0.25.
  </li>
  <li><b>Preserve polygon topology during simplification:</b><br>
  If map simplification is on polygons are normally simplfied
  with a fast algorithm that does not grant that the topologie
  is preserved. This is no problem in common cases. If you experience
  some problems with polygon simplification turn this option on. 
  On the downside this slows down the simplification speed significantly!
