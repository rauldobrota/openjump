Java Beans storing the GIS relevant data extracted from
OpenJump and providing wiring with the SVG document.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The classes of this package are used to store the state
which can not be modeled in SVG itself (e.g. meta data
from the GIS). To avoid conflicts with XML events the
data is wired with its own event sytem.
