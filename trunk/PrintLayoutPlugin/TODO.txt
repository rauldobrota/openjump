To do for next release
----------------------


General Feature Wishes
----------------------

* an option for landscape x portrait printing

* For most practical applications it is important to be able to
  produce a scaled drawing on paper, often at some nice rounded
  value (like 1: 10000)

* error management and user feedback Systems

* just one properties button

* loading of WMS maps (cbb: works to some extent now) 

* refactor: too many different Actions in LayoutFrame.
* refactor: use new factory model Map2SVGConverter
            to separate *JUMP version specific features.
