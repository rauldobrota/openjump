To do for next release
----------------------

* DocumentManager: - small clean up of the code

* update the used Batik libraries.

General Feature Wishes
----------------------

* an option for landscape x portrait printing

* For most practical applications it is important to be able to
  produce a scaled drawing on paper, often at some nice rounded
  value (like 1: 10000)

* Evaluate/Test:
  Instead of using an built-in PDF converter maybe using a print
  driver (like PDF995) is more effective for saving printed images all
  nicely set out. This driver will also produce multi-page outputs.

* error management and user feedback Systems

* SVG order change system

* just one properties button

* loading of rasterdata

* loading of WMS maps

* refactor: too many different Actions in LayoutFrame.
* refactor: very long methods in LayoutFrame.
