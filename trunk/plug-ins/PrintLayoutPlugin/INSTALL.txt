How to install a prepared PrintLayout plugin jar file
=====================================================

This is a description how to install a prepared jar-file.
Along with this text you should find a file printlayout.jar.

If you work with CVS versions, your should now better refer
to the file README.txt.

1. Copy the the printlayout.jar
   into the the lib/ext directory of
   your OpenJump installation.

ATTENTION: The next steps replace existing jar files. Be sure
you don't get into trouble when you loose these files. Backups
or a separate installation of OpenJump could help here.

NOTE: OpenJUMP 1.2: You don't need to update batik, xml-apis and xml-apis-ext
anymore, because the version included in OpenJUMP 1.2 is already sufficient.

2 [OpenJump 1.0] Remove the batik libraries coming with
   OpenJump and replace them:

   rm -rf <where you installed OpenJump>/lib/batik

3 [OpenJump 1.0] Download these jar files and place them into
   <where you installed OpenJump>/lib

   http://jump-pilot.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/jump-pilot/openjump/lib/batik/batik-all.jar
   http://jump-pilot.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/jump-pilot/openjump/lib/xml-apis-ext.jar
   http://jump-pilot.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/jump-pilot/openjump/lib/xml-apis.jar

4 [OpenJump 1.0 and 1.2] Download these jar files and place them into
   <where you installed OpenJump>/lib

   http://jump-pilot.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/jump-pilot/PrintLayoutPlugin/lib/js.jar
   http://jump-pilot.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/jump-pilot/PrintLayoutPlugin/lib/pdf-transcoder.jar


5. Only on Windows, likely for OpenJUMP 1.0, maybe for other releases:
   You need to use the .bat start file and fix CLASSPATH there.

   The orginal openjump.bat adds all old batik jars
   to the CLASSPATH explicitly.

   You have to remove all %LIB%/batik/foobar.jar
   and add %LIB%/batik-all.jar
