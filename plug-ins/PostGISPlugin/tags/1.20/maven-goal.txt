somme usefull maven goal

somme common build life cicle:

    * validate  - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
    * compile - compile the source code of the project
    * test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. 
    	These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
    * package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
    * integration-test - process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run
    * verify - run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria
    * install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
    * deploy - done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

The Ant Plugin has two goals:

    * ant:ant Generate Ant build files.
    * ant:clean Clean all Ant build files.
    
Another package :

	* javadoc:jar - creates an archive file of the generated javadocs. 
		It is used during the release process to create the javadoc artifact for the project's release. 
		This artifact is uploaded to the remote repository along with the project's compiled binary and source archive.
	* source:jar - build sources and ressources in jar format
	* eclipse:eclipse - build .clathpass and .project (add variable M2_REPO link onto your local repository) 
	* site - build site
