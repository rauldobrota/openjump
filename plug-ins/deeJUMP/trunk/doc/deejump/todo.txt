HIGH Priority
-------------

- WMS request: strip anything after the ?

Maybe there is something missing in my configuration. For example, are 
these issues related to this and similar errors in jump.log:
"11:14:36,640 ERROR (AbstractPlugIn.java:createName:91) - Can't find 
resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, 
key de.latlon.deejump.plugin.style.DeeChangeStylesPlugIn 
de.latlon.deejump.plugin.style.DeeChangeStylesPlugIn"? 


2 - Change style menu / "Point Display Typ" (e missing) :

- If you import a point layer and try to change "Point Display Typ" into bitmap before choosing a bitmap, it ends into a NPE. If you choose the bitmap first, you don't have to select bitmap to get it displayed.

- There are both a vertices size choozer and a point size chooser, but vertices and points menus seem to be synchronized in some ways. May be a clear distinction between point (a Geometry) and vertices (a coordinate) have to be done (let points have a representation for its coordinate and another for the feature geometry).

- When you choose a bitmap and select, for example, circle, then close the Change Style dialog box and open it again, you alternatively have the vertices checkbox set to true, then false, then true...

- Is the point size supposed to apply to bitmaps ? 


- Use Request elements defined in Capabilities request
- WFS cancel request (on monitor dialog)





LOW Priority
-------------

- WFS adapter -> what if no schema?, then only get feature w/o props
- WFS adapter geo pro not recognized properly 8guessGeoPro, with PG db THE_GEOM
use new mthod public FeatureTypeProperty[] getGeometryProperties() {
- WFS adapter plug-in, when no window -> null pointer...
- WFS adapter: (Re-)connect must reset GUI! (especially remove cached schemas and other stuff)
- java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: host parameter is null
- WFS adapter native deegree FC


NICE-TO-HAVE
------------

- WMS STYLES fehlen


OpenJUMP TO DOs
---------------

- Skin stuff!

 - commons-loggin.jar x log4j.jar ?
 - explain them! (style guide, development guide?)
 - WMS 1.1
 - repeated get wms capabilties request
 - change language on-the-fly?
 - JPP-specific stuff -> package org.jpp. For example, org.jpp.i18n
 - Fix bug in com.vividsolutions.jump.workbench.ui.plugin.wms.EditWMSQueryPlugIn.java (already reported to Jon Aquino)
 - jump.properties is 2x there!
 - remove references to JDOM
